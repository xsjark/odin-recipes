    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a popular oven-baked pasta dish of fresh egg pasta squares. It is a traditional dish from Bologna in
        Northern Italy, where the sheets are always green through the addition of spinach or nettles to the egg dough.
        In Bologna, these home made sheets are layered with small amounts of real Bolognese ragù (made with both beef
        and pork, very little tomato and no southern herbs like oregano and basil but a little nutmeg instead) and
        similarly small amounts of "besciamella" or béchamel sauce in an oven dish. There are at least 5 layers of pasta
        dough, and the layers stay separate and do not "merge" together into a mush. A light sprinkling of
        Parmigiano-Reggiano , and a few dabs of butter end the dish which is then baked for about half an hour. The use
        of Mozzarella in place of Béchamel suggests a Neapolitan variation to the original Bologna classic, as does the
        use of Ricotta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
