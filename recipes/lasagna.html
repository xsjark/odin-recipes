    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a popular oven-baked pasta dish of fresh egg pasta squares. It is a traditional dish from Bologna in
        Northern Italy, where the sheets are always green through the addition of spinach or nettles to the egg dough.
        In Bologna, these home made sheets are layered with small amounts of real Bolognese ragù (made with both beef
        and pork, very little tomato and no southern herbs like oregano and basil but a little nutmeg instead) and
        similarly small amounts of "besciamella" or béchamel sauce in an oven dish. There are at least 5 layers of pasta
        dough, and the layers stay separate and do not "merge" together into a mush. A light sprinkling of
        Parmigiano-Reggiano , and a few dabs of butter end the dish which is then baked for about half an hour. The use
        of Mozzarella in place of Béchamel suggests a Neapolitan variation to the original Bologna classic, as does the
        use of Ricotta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) package whole milk ricotta</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9×13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add ground beef and onion and cook until beef has
            browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; season with salt and pepper, to
            taste. Drain excess fat. Stir in tomatoes and Italian seasoning until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella and egg; set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the
            ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Repeat with a second layer. Top with remaining noodles,
            tomato mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Place into oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until bubbling. Then broil for 2-3 minutes, or until top is
            browned in spots.</li>
        <li>Let cool 15 minutes. Serve, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
